The average chef coming up with a nightly special may be considering hundreds of different ingredients, each with the potential to be paired and prepared in a vast multitude of ways. The possibilities quickly reach the quintillions. And the goal is incredibly vague: Taste good. 
<br><br>
A chef must choose their own pieces to construct not an objective goal (a checkmate), but a complex and highly subjective interplay of flavor, texture, and presentation to delight our senses. The main goal of this site is to make cooking easy and delicious. With the help of this webpage anyone can cook easily without any prior experience.
