<h2> Welcome to my Web Page </h2>

 
        
        <p> Hello, <br><br>
        I am from Hyderabad, Joint capital of southern Indian states Telangana and Andhra Pradesh is along the banks of the Musi River, presently I am pursuing my Master's degree at Georgia State University. I like to learn new things. It could be either a new technology, a Concept or a process... And that's my motto everyday. I like intelligent conversations and be among smart people. I prefer, being alone and think about ideas. I usually relax by hearing to music.<br>
